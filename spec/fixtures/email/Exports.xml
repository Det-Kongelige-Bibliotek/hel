Christen/Claus,

Thank you for the call yesterday, but my apologies for the delay in joining.
I had meetings all afternoon right up against each other and they inevitably
pushed each other to make me late.

A quick piece of feedback on the Adobe Connect platform.  Oddly, I could
hear Sara very clearly indeed, and Nik reasonably clearly, but your voice
was quite crackly.  Do you think this relates to the microphone being used?
How did I come across?

As to future actions, I will draft some WG charters in the next week and
send them to you for an initial look.  I would then like to share them via
hydra-community to get wider feedback and invite contribution.  I would hope
we can then confirm the WGs at the next call and proceed from there.  I will
also email Karen Estlund re: the Metadata Interest Group to scope how we
link any work on PCDM to them.

Regards,

Chris
